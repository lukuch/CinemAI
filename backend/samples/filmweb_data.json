    "description": "Yale University, 1961.  Stanley Milgram designs a psychology experiment in which  people  think  they’re  delivering  electric  shocks  to  an  affable  stranger strapped into a chair in another room. Subjects are told it’s about memory, but the experiment is really about conformity, conscience, and free will. Milgram is trying to test people’s tendency to comply with authority. His controversial experiments and results hit a nerve, and got him accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster. Much like Mad Men and Masters of Sex, EXPERIMENTER  is  a stylish and engaging look at a fascinating period of American history. It features a strong cast including  Winona Ryder (Black Swan), Peter Sarsgaard (Black Mass), Taryn Manning (TV series Orange is the New Black) and John Leguizamo (John Wick).",

    "description": "This most recent directorial effort from the iconic actor takes us back to the 16th century to somewhere deep in the Central American jungle. Jaguar Paw, a warrior from a tribe living in harmony with his surroundings, is captured by the ruthless Maya. Chained and bound, he is taken on a grueling journey to a decadent metropolis where only cruelty awaits. His struggle for freedom is only beginning.… Mel Gibson followed up on his controversial The Passion of the Christ with another epic drama, filmed with an ambitious level of authenticity, not just in its consistent use of the Yucatec Maya language but also in its bold depiction of the utter brutality of the era. \"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within,” states the opening quote by Will Durant, thus presenting the moral questions contained within the film’s raw narrative. The story is set against the backdrop of the mysterious decline of the expansionist Maya, who fell under the weight of their own pride and insatiability.",

In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story.\r\n\r\nIn the Heart of the Sea reveals the encounter’s harrowing aftermath, as the ship’s surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.",

She falls in love with her good-looking boss only to soon find out that she’s just something on the side: his steady gal is both thin and rich. In her disappointment she gives notice at the publishing house where she’s been quite happy, and plunges headlong into a career as a television reporter – a profession, she finds out, which involves far more than merely smiles and success. Out of the blue her mother, who was always willing to do anything for her daughter’s happiness (read ‘to help her get married’), begins promoting a certain old suitor, while her father looks on silently with a tragic expression on his face. But Bridget doesn’t need even well-meant advice since she’s feeling like a regular ball of fire. At least she’s got a bottle of her favourite Chardonnay close at hand and a pack of cigarettes.",

But how did this unknown Austrian boy seduce the German people into becoming a Nazi state? Why did Germany follow Hitler to the brink of destruction? Fest's documentary film answers these questions by tracing the roots of fascism to Germany's historical heritage. Using unseen footage from the German war archives, “Hitler: A Career” presents a compelling picture of the rise and fall of Hitler and the Nazi empire. It was not Hitler who created Nazi Germany; but Germany itself that created Hitler.",

It ties in with the popular tradition in the USA in the 1970s of screening B movies on double bills. Unfortunately the Grindhouse films are to be released separately in the Czech Republic. Tarantino’s part, Death Proof, brings to the screen the character of psychopath Stuntman Mike, played by the somewhat neglected legend of 1980s action films, Kurt Russell. Mike can only be sexually aroused by killing young girls with his souped up Dodge. One night in Texas, Jungle Julia, the best DJ far and wide, catches his eye. After Stuntman Mike kills her and her friends he spends some time in the hospital, but nobody stops him from continuing his cross-country rampage. He goes on to Tennessee where another four unsuspecting girls come under his line of fire. But what Stuntman Mike doesn’t know is that a couple of them can drive a Dodge even better than him.",

Abrams teams with writer Drew Goddard and director Matt Reeves for this frenetic tale of a powerful destructive force that descends upon New York City, and the four desperate people who put their lives on the line to embark on a perilous rescue mission. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) is a young American professional who has recently been offered a coveted new job in Japan. Eager to send his older sibling off in style, Rob's younger brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), organize a surprise going-away party to take place the night before Rob boards his Eastern-bound flight. As the party gets underway, Rob's longtime friend and current love interest, Beth (Odette Yustman), shows up with another man as the dejected guest of honor's best-pal Hud (T.J. Miller) encourages partygoer Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) to wish him an on-camera farewell despite the fact that they barely know one another. Moments after Beth storms out following a bitter skirmish with Rob, the entire New York City skyline goes dark. Power is quickly restored, prompting partygoers to turn their attention toward the news, where they learn that a freight tanker has been overturned in New York Harbor. Racing to the rooftop in hopes of getting a better look at the situation, the group is terrified to witness a massive explosion that rains debris across midtown Manhattan, causing mass chaos and unparalleled destruction. But the worst is yet to come, because it soon becomes apparent that this is not the work of a terrorist or an act of war, but a massive creature beyond human comprehension. Now, as the military moves in and the streets of New York City become a virtual war zone, Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud race to rescue Beth and get out of the city before the powers that be unleash the ultimate weapon of mass destruction on one of the most populated cities on the planet.",

    "description": "Thirty years have passed since the first audiences were welcomed to Lumberton for a peek behind the spotless exteriors of the family houses of small-town America. And the view was shocking. Director David Lynch set carefully concealed evil in contrast to the dreamlike purity of love, thereby creating a work that quickly became a cult classic. The finding of a dismembered human ear is the pretext for a postmodern crime drama that ushers us into a world where student Jeffrey (played by the inimitable Kyle MacLachlan) becomes an unwitting voyeur, observing through the slats in a closet door the terror committed against beautiful singer Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) by a sociopathic thug named Frank (the terrifyingly convincing Dennis Hopper). Jeffrey is ultimately rescued by Sandy, who is the only one able to offer him affection unfraught with perversion. When completed, Blue Velvet was summarily refused by so many American distributors that producer Dino De Laurentiis had to found his own distribution company so the film could be screened in theaters. The movie will be presented in its digitally restored version.",

On remote alpine faces, the free-spirited 23-year-old makes some of the boldest solo ascents in history. Yet, he draws scant attention. With no cameras, no rope, and no margin for error, Marc-André's approach is the essence of solo adventure. Intrigued by these quiet accomplishments, veteran filmmaker Peter Mortimer (The Dawn Wall) sets out to make a film about Marc-André. But the Canadian soloist is an elusive subject: nomadic and publicity shy, he doesn't own a phone or car, and is reluctant to let the film crew in on his pure vision of climbing.",

Academy Award nominees Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal star as a divorced couple discovering dark truths about each other and themselves in “Nocturnal Animals.”\r\n Susan Morrow, a Los Angeles art dealer (portrayed by Ms. Adams), lives an incredibly privileged yet unfulfilled life with her husband Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer). One weekend, as Hutton departs on one of his too-frequent business trips, Susan receives an unsolicited package that has been left in her mailbox. It is a novel, Nocturnal Animals, written by her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Mr. Gyllenhaal), with whom she has had no contact for years. Edward’s note accompanying the manuscript encourages Susan to read the work and then to contact him during his visit to the city. Alone at night, in bed, Susan begins reading. The novel is dedicated to her…\r\n …but its content is violent and devastating. While Susan reads, she is deeply moved by Edward’s writing and cannot help but reminisce over the most private moments from her own love story with the author. Trying to look within herself and beyond the glossy surface of the life and career that she has made, Susan increasingly interprets the book as a tale of revenge, a tale that forces her to re-evaluate the choices that she has made, and re-awakens a love that she feared was lost – as the story builds to a reckoning that will define both the novel’s hero and her own.",

But only until an ordinary situation – the kind of slight injustice that millions of people the world over have to face on a daily basis – yanks the conformist mask of normality from their faces. Nerves become frayed and boundaries of decent behaviour are overstepped with the speed of a rabid animal.

Nothing happens during their first encounter but Connie can’t stop thinking about this bohemian-looking young man. She seeks him out once more and they become lovers. Their sexual experimentation grows into a passionate erotic relationship which eventually comes out into the open. The deluded husband (Richard Gere) has Connie followed, he acquires evidence in the form of compromising photographs and then pays his rival a visit. In a fit of anger he kills Paul and manages to get rid of the body. But Connie finds out the truth… This psychological thriller with its erotic subtext is a remake of Chabrol’s film Unfaithful Wife (1969) in which the central figures were played by Stéphane Audran and Michel Bouquet. Director Adrian Lyne again proves his ability to create an attractive setting, particularly evident in the passionate love scenes. The piquant story about a “dangerous liaison” also probes the female psyche and presents a testimony of the lives of middle-class Americans. The director toys with props (murder weapon) and the atmosphere of growing passion and increasing suspicion to form a drama about guilt and conscience with an open ending…",

We shuffle time and place, reality and nightmare as we venture into Pink's painful memories, each on a \"brick\" in the wall he has gradually built around his feelings.

Newly ascertained circumstances of the case, however, unexpectedly place Wiesler on the other side of the fence. The protagonist’s lifelong priorities are at stake, as is his safety. The crux of the film lies not only in the fact that Wiesler is trapped among his listening devices without anyone to talk to, but mainly that each spoken word can mean ruin.

Zion in Wisconsin. The journey on a small grass cutter covered hundreds of kilometers and took over six weeks. He did all of this to make up with his brother Lyle, age 76 and severely ill. The two brothers had not been on speaking terms for over ten years. Rose, Alvin’s daughter had a telephone call to the effect that Lyle, her uncle, had suffered a stroke. Alvin thought about his relationship with his brother, and came to the conclusion that it was about time for the two of them to bury resentment over the past. There were, however, obstacles to overcome such as his impaired vision and a lack of money. Under the eye of his perplexed daughter, he takes to the road dragging a makeshift trailer with a load of supplies such as gasoline, coffee, insect repelent, candy, and some canned goods. His journey will be of reconciliation with Lyle and also with himself.\r\n",

    "description": "A time capsule containing a cryptic message about the coming apocalypse sends a concerned father on a race to prevent the horrific events from unfolding as predicted in this sci-fi thriller directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City) and starring Nicolas Cage. 1958: As the dedication ceremony for a newly constructed elementary school gets under way, a time capsule containing student drawings of the future is buried on the grounds and scheduled to be unearthed on the school's 50th anniversary. Instead of submitting a drawing, however, one little girl scribbles a series of seemingly random numbers on her paper before it is buried. Fifty years later, the time capsule is unearthed for a new generation of students to examine. Young Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) is one of those students. The mysterious sequence of numbers falling into his possession, Caleb takes the paper to his father, Professor John Koestler (Cage), for examination. Studying the numbers, Professor Koestler soon discovers that they aren't random at all, but an encoded message containing the precise dates, death tolls, and coordinates of every major disaster since the time capsule was buried. Not only that, but the document also indicates that there will be three more such events, the last of which indicates a doomsday scenario that appears directly tied to Professor Koestler and Caleb. His desperate plea to authorities falling on deaf ears, Professor Koestler realizes that his only hope for preventing more lives from being lost is to take personal action. Though the author of the prophecies is no longer living, Professor Koestler is eventually able to track down her daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), and granddaughter Abby, who reluctantly agree to aid in the investigation. As the final date on the list draws near, Professor Koestler enters into a frantic race against time to prevent destruction on a global scale, in the process realizing that in order to save millions of lives, he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.",

On one such visitation, looking after the kids becomes a little more difficult when, after a series of strange lighting storms hit his neighborhood, Ray discovers that a fleet of death-ray robotic spaceships have emerged nearby, part of the first wave of an all-out alien invasion of the Earth. Transporting his children from New York to Boston in an attempt to find safety at Mary Ann's parents' house, Ray must learn to become the protector and provider he never was in marriage.

Time passes and each member of the group finds himself pursuing other opportunities in the States, until Charlie rallies them together for a revenge-motivated scheme designed to bilk Steve of all his misbegotten earnings. In order to cinch the deal, he even enlists John's reluctant safecracking-prodigy daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), for an elaborate, incognito Los Angeles heist. But the paranoid Steve proves himself to be one step ahead of them at just about every turn, and Charlie finds that he'll have to make some daring last-minute changes to their plan if the team is to succeed.

Danny Boyle has gone on to make many films in a wide variety of genres but none seem to have resonated with audiences quite as much as Trainspotting. Is this due to Ewan McGregor’s empathetic portrayal of drug addict Renton, the breakneck style that the film employs or the colourful cast of deplorable and relatable characters? Regardless, and despite the sometimes-difficult subject matter, the enduring nature of Trainspotting seems to have extended well into the 21st century.",

    "description": "One of the best works from among the fifty films that Sidney Lumet directed over the course of his life. Here, too, we recognize his trademark social criticism, this time aimed at the media’s power to manipulate public opinion. At the forefront of the story, however, is a brilliant character study of two thieves who decide to rob a bank – unfortunately for them, after all the money has already been removed. In the following dramatic and absurd situations, Sonny and Sal (together with the bank employees they have taken hostage) are holed up in the bank, with the police, journalists, TV reporters and mobs of onlookers besieging them outside. A few hours of live television coverage manage to turn the crime into a sensational event that gives the thieves a false sense of grandeur and makes it practically impossible for them to surrender. And in this artificially turbulent atmosphere, there is no room for Sonny’s personal story: He was robbing the bank in order to get the money for his transsexual partner’s operation.",

Featuring candid discussion of both Stutz's and Hill's personal mental health journeys, alongside the lighthearted banter of two friends from different generations, the film beautifully frames the Tools and the journey toward mental health in a manner that's accessible to anyone - whether or not they are actively seeking help.",

    "description": "\"Fatal attraction\" has become a household term for love turned to murderous obsession, thanks to the success of Adrian Lyne's 1987 movie. Dan (Michael Douglas) is a family man whose one-night affair with Alex (Glenn Close) turns into a nightmare when she insists on continuing the relationship, claiming to be carrying his baby. Alex systematically terrorizes Dan, even temporarily kidnapping his daughter, in her attempts to win back his affection. Douglas' besieged family man guiltily tries to preserve his marriage and family from the consequences of his own indiscretion. Close's performance as the love-struck psycho-siren remains her signature role: She conveys the buried feminist message of the film in her challenge to Dan to take responsibility for his sexual behavior.

    "description": "Prepare yourself for an unparalleled sensory experience. SAMSARA reunites director Ron Fricke and producer Mark Magidson, whose award-winning films BARAKA and CHRONOS were acclaimed for combining visual and musical artistry. SAMSARA is a Sanskrit word that means “the ever turning wheel of life” and is the point of departure for the filmmakers as they search for the elusive current of interconnection that runs through our lives. Filmed over a period of almost five years and in twenty-five countries, SAMSARA transports us to sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial sites, and natural wonders. By dispensing with dialogue and descriptive text, SAMSARA subverts our expectations of a traditional documentary, instead encouraging our own inner interpretations inspired by images and music that infuses the ancient with the modern.\r\n\r\n Expanding on the themes they developed in BARAKA (1992) and CHRONOS (1985), SAMSARA explores the wonders of our world from the mundane to the miraculous, looking into the unfathomable reaches of man’s spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, SAMSARA takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation. Through powerful images, the film illuminates the links between humanity and the rest of nature, showing how our life cycle mirrors the rhythm of the planet.\r\n\r\n The filmmakers approach non verbal filmmaking with an understanding that it must live up to the standard of great still photography, revealing the essence of a subject, not just its physical presence. SAMSARA was photographed entirely in 70mm film utilizing both standard frame rates and with a motion control time-lapse camera designed specifically for this project. This camera system allows perspective shifts to reveal extraordinary views of ordinary scenes. The images were then transferred through the highest resolution scanning process available to the new 4K digital projection format that allows for mesmerizing images of unprecedented clarity. SAMSARA will be a showpiece for the new, high-resolution 4K digital projection, the HD format, as well as standard digital and film projection.",

Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck and Martin Balsam, from the 1962 original, have fun cameos, but it’s Juliette Lewis who steals the show, with a performance of thumb-sucking notoriety. While Scorsese retains Bernard Herrmann’s thunderous score, he presents clever twists on the story such as making Nolte’s character a liberal defence lawyer, targeted by Cady for perceived lack of effort, rather than the prosecutor of the original film. Scorsese may enjoy toying with the presumptions of both liberal and conservative notions of justice, but the director here is really in freewheeling mode, revelling in the story’s visceral thrills and the heightened mania of De Niro’s central performance.",

But before he can ride off into the sunset, Nick is pressured to do one last job by his mentor and business partner, a flamboyant and extravagant upscale fence named Max (Marlon Brando). Max is plotting the heist of the Montreal Customs House, and he's got a man on the inside, Jackie Teller (Edward Norton), a talented but volatile crook who has managed to ingratiate himself with the facility's staff as a fellow employee suffering from cerebral palsy. Jackie bristles at Nick's interference in \"his\" score, however, and threatens violence when it seems he's going to be cut out of the action. In the meantime, Nick grows increasingly ill at ease about the operation, as it violates his two most important dictums in thievery: always work alone and never pull a job in your own city. The part of Max in The Score was written specifically for Brando by screenwriter Salem, although the improvisational star and his director Oz reportedly clashed during filming.",

    "description": "21 Grams is the new film from the Academy Award-nominated director of Amores perros, Alejandro González Iñárritu. It is a story of hope and humanity, of resilience and survival.\r\n\r\nWhether you fear death or not, it comes, and at that moment your body becomes twenty-one grams lighter. Is it a person's soul that constitutes those twenty-one grams? Is that weight carried by those who survive us?\r\nThe lead actors in 21 Grams are three-time Academy Award nominee Sean Penn, Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro, and award-winning actress Naomi Watts. The actors were all honored at the film's world premiere at the 2003 Venice International Film Festival, where Sean Penn won Best Actor and Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts earned the Audience Awards for Best Actor and Actress.\r\n\r\n21 Grams, written by Guillermo Arriaga (Amores perros), explores the emotionally and physically charged existences of three people over a period of several months. An accident unexpectedly throws their lives and destinies together, in a story that will take them to the heights of love, the depths of revenge, and the promise of redemption.\r\n\r\nCollege professor Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) and his wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg) find their union precariously balanced between life and death. He is mortally ill and awaiting a heart transplant, while she hopes to become pregnant with his child through artificial insemination. Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts), having matured since her reckless past, is a beloved older sister to Claudia (Clea DuVall), a good wife to Michael (Danny Huston) and loving mother to two little girls. Her family radiates hope and joy. Much farther down the socioeconomic scale, ex-con Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) and his wife Marianne (Melissa Leo) struggle to provide for their two children while Jack reaffirms his commitment to religion.\r\n\r\nA tragic accident that claims several lives places these couples in each other's orbit. In the aftermath, Paul confronts his own mortality, Cristina takes action to come to terms with her present and perhaps her future, and Jack's faith is put to the test. If spiritual equilibrium is to be regained by any one of them, it could come at great cost to the others. Yet the will to live, and the instinct to reach out to another person for support, remains ever-present among them all.",

His plays (which include The Lieutenant of Inishmore and The Pillowman) have brought him two Olivier Awards and four Tony Award nominations. He wrote and directed Six Shooter, starring Brendan Gleeson, which earned him the 2006 Academy Award for Best Live-Action Short Film.\r\nIn Bruges was filmed on location; Bruges (pronounced \"broozh\"), the most well-preserved medieval city in the whole of Belgium, is a welcoming destination for travellers from all over the world. But for hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), it could be their final destination; a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before Christmas by their London boss Harry (two-time Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes) to go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nVery much out of place amidst the gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city.\r\n\r\nBut the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloë (Clémence Poésy), who may have some dark secrets of her own.\r\n\r\nAnd when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences.",

Blow is one of the many bizarre stories life offers filmmakers. The film picks up George Jung in the sixties during his first contact with the world of drugs on the beaches of California. At that time, marijuana deals for him were still a means of attaining the American Dream. Then, thanks to his acquaintance with recruiters for the Medellín cartel, he becomes a professional smuggler. He is just one link in a chain transporting white powder from Latin America to customers in the US. The film employs a rather dry humour to show how the son of a poor but respectable construction worker was transformed over night into a nouveau riche, who has trouble storing his wall to wall cash. With probing detail the film outlines the rise and fall of a small-town boy who blows all his dreams through greed.",

    "description": "Inspired by the first 150 pages of Upton Sinclair’s socially critical novel, “Oil!” and the biography of Californian oil magnate Edward L. Doheny (1856-1935), Paul Thomas Anderson’s film tells the story of Daniel Plainview, who sets off in search of silver in the west of America at the turn of the last century, finds oil instead, and within just a few years becomes an incredibly rich tycoon.\r\nPlainview’s rise to power is ruthless. Making use of his little son, H. W., he manages to persuade many farmers to relinquish mining rights on their own farmland. However, this eloquent self-made man is in danger of failing when it comes to Christian fundamentalist lay preacher Eli Sunday and his family. When he finally does gain permission to drill for oil on Eli’s land, the preacher turns into a formidable opponent who tries in his overly pious sermons to put a stop to Plainview’s push to modernise the land – and even forces the cold and cynical entrepreneur to get down on his knees.\r\nPlainview’s star begins to fall when H. W. goes deaf following an accident on a derrick tower. Having risked his life time and again in his search for black gold, and, wholly consumed by his greed, Plainview’s misanthropic personality comes increasingly to the fore until finally he does not even stop at cold-blooded murder. The price that Plainview pays for his gigantic fortune is high and, what began as the search for happiness ends in rancour and loneliness.",

But a flock of birds flew into the plane engines at 2,800 feet, forcing the pilot to perform an emergency water landing, which he executed perfectly. Everybody on board survived in what became known as the “Miracle on the Hudson,” all thanks to Sully’s pilot skills and experience. The incident, however, had an emotionally devastating effect on the captain, especially after a few witness reports put his career and reputation in jeopardy and he was summoned by the National Transportation Safety Board to defend his actions.

Inspired by true events, Ron Woodroof’s story of strength is told in Dallas Buyers Club, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée from an original screenplay by Craig Borten & Melisa Wallack. Spirit Award winner Matthew McConaughey portrays the real-life character, whose self-interest is galvanized into something much more.\r\nA son of Texas, Ron Woodroof is an electrician and rodeo cowboy. In 1985, he is well into an unexamined existence with a devil-may-care lifestyle. Suddenly, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence.\r\n\r\nHis crash course of research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S., so Ron crosses the border into Mexico. There, he learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Screen Actors Guild Award winner Jennifer Garner).\r\n\r\nAn outsider to the gay community, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Gotham Independent Film Award winner Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron’s lust for life. Rayon also shares Ron’s entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a “buyers club,” where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Deep in the heart of Texas, Ron’s pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, the embattled Lone Star loner lives life to the fullest like never before.",

Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing the Dawn Wall. Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?",

    "description": "Described as one of the most influential female boxers of all time, helping legitimize women’s participation in the sport, Christy Martin shocked the world by becoming a superstar after winning a blood-soaked undercard match at the Mike Tyson/Frank Bruno fight in 1996. Growing up in a small town in West Virginia, Martin was a popular standout athlete, and as she began to win her first amateur fights, she struggled with being open about her sexual orientation, choosing to keep her relationships with women secret. She later found a coach in Jim Martin, a professional boxing trainer who, despite his initial skepticism about “women’s boxing,” signed on to help train her. They would later become romantically involved, despite their 20-year-plus age difference. After landing on Don King’s radar, Martin, under the moniker “The Coal Miner’s Daughter,” experienced a meteoric rise, including the cover of Sports Illustrated, breaking pay-per-view records in women’s boxing along the way. The fall from that height was steep and included substance abuse, domestic violence and a harrowing brush with death. Martin reveals how she battled back to level ground and a content personal life, which now includes an induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Additional interviewees include Mike Tyson, Laila Ali, Martin’s family, and convicted attempted murderer Jim Martin speaks for the first time since his imprisonment.",

    "description": "November 19, 2004, is a moment the NBA would rather soon forget, but for the players, coaches, referees, and fans who lived through it, it’s simply a night they can’t shake from their memory or their reputation. It was an early season game, but for the perennially losing Indiana Pacers, there was no better place to stamp their newfound dominance than against the defending champions and bitter rival Detroit Pistons. As the game neared its end, Indiana firebrand Ron Artest shoved Detroit’s Ben Wallace, sparking a brawl between the two clubs. When one fan arced a perfectly tossed cup of beer onto Artest’s chest, it unleashed a type of melee that had never been seen before in the history of the NBA: players rushed into the stands, fans rushed onto the court, and police rushed into the building trying to control the pandemonium. Days later, in an effort to protect the league’s image, commissioner David Stern would suspend Artest for the entirety of the season, along with 30 games for his teammate Stephen Jackson and 25 for Jermaine O’Neal, the longest suspensions in NBA history. The media then followed, labeling the players involved an unruly bunch of “thugs.” Now, for the first time, we show the never- before-seen footage of that night and hear the story first hand from those that lived it, giving the players an opportunity to explain their actions and defend their character against a night that left their reputations stained both on and off the court.",

The definition of a cult film, the Coen brothers’ film was only a moderate success upon release but has since gone on to inspire fervent devotion, legions of fans (‘achievers’) and its own religion (Dudeism). Critical respectability has followed suit; it’s been selected for the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry and Paul Schrader has argued its place as the 40th greatest film of all time in a piece for Film Comment. Its durability is largely down to its sheer consistency of laughs (and its endless quotability), but in the end The Big Lebowski is also a wry meditation on masculinity, heroism and friendship.",

A meek and patient psychiatrist tries to get him to tell what happened, but realises he doesn’t have much time. It was necessary to start a few months ago. When, two days before Christmas, precisely amidst those same mountains, a sixteen-year-old girl disappeared: Anna Lou had red hair and freckles.

    "description": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures presents director Eli Roth’s reimagining of the 1974 revenge thriller \"Death Wish.\" Dr. Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis) is a surgeon who only sees the aftermath of his city's violence when it is rushed into his ER – until his wife (Elisabeth Shue) and college-age daughter (Camila Morrone) are viciously attacked in their suburban home. With the police overloaded with crimes, Paul, burning for revenge, hunts his family’s assailants to deliver justice. As the anonymous slayings of criminals grabs the media’s attention, the city wonders if this deadly avenger is a guardian angel or a grim reaper. Fury and fate collide in the intense, action-thriller \"Death Wish.\" Paul Kersey becomes a divided person: A man who saves lives, and a man who takes them; a husband and father trying to take care of his family, and a shadowy figure fighting crime; a surgeon extracting bullets from suspects’ bodies, and a man seeking justice that detectives are quickly closing in on. Updated from the original novel by Brian Garfield, director Eli Roth  and screenwriter Joe Carnahan’s (\"The Grey,\" \"Narc\") \"Death Wish\" also stars Vincent D’Onofrio (\"The Magnificent Seven,\" TV’s \"Daredevil\" and \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\"), Elisabeth Shue (\"Leaving Las Vegas\"), Camila Morrone, Dean Norris (\"Breaking Bad\") and Kimberly Elise (\"The Great Debaters\"). It’s a knife’s-edge portrayal that challenges our assumptions, and pushes our buttons. By bringing the complex psychology of Brian Garfield’s book up-to-the-moment and injecting new thrills and a stark, unflinching look at the American psyche in 2018, Eli Roth and \"Death Wish\" brings audiences to the height of unforgettable suspense.",

    "description": "Introducing a groundbreaking technique that seamlessly merges computer-generated and hand-drawn animation techniques, first-time director John Kahrs takes the art of animation in a bold new direction with “Paperman.” Using a minimalist black-and-white style, the short follows the story of a lonely young man in mid-century New York City, whose destiny takes an unexpected turn after a chance meeting with a beautiful woman on his morning commute. Convinced the girl of his dreams is gone forever, he gets a second chance when he spots her in a skyscraper window across the avenue from his office. With only his heart, imagination and a stack of papers to get her attention, his efforts are no match for what the fates have in store for him. Created by a small, innovative team working at Walt Disney Animation Studios, “Paperman” pushes the animation medium in an exciting new direction.",

Celebrated as one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, Honnold’s climb set the ultimate standard: perfection or death. Succeeding in this challenge places his story in the annals of human achievement. FREE SOLO is an edge-of-your seat thriller and an inspiring portrait of an athlete who challenges both his body and his beliefs on a quest to triumph over the impossible, revealing the personal toll of excellence. As the climber begins his training, the armor of invincibility he’s built up over decades unexpectedly breaks apart when Honnold begins to fall in love, threatening his focus and giving way to injury and setbacks. Vasarhelyi and Chin succeed in beautifully capturing deeply human moments with Honnold as well as the death-defying climb with exquisite artistry and masterful, vertigo-inducing camerawork. The result is a triumph of the human spirit that represents what The New York Times calls \"a miraculous opportunity for the rest of us to experience the human sublime.\"",

Completely off-grid in a remote forest in the Pacific Northwest, the Cash family hunt wild animals for food and eschew all contact with the outside world. But an unexpected family development finds them reconnecting with both American society and an extended family they’d tried to avoid.

Combining canny comedy with touching drama, Ross’ thought-provoking fable prods and teases out notions of 21st-century idealism and materialism. But as its heart this is a film about family and the perils of parenthood; a fertile theme for the best in US indie cinema from Little Miss Sunshine though to When We Were Young and Maggie’s Plan.",

Now, they’re going to have to do it for real. In Pixels, when intergalactic aliens discover video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth, using the video games as the models for their assaults -- and now-U.S. President Cooper must call on his old-school arcade friends to save the world from being destroyed by PAC-MAN, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede, and Space Invaders. Joining them is Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan), a specialist supplying the arcaders with unique weapons to fight the aliens.",

With his partner Simon Yates, Simpson successfully reached the peak after a three-day climb. During the descent, however, he fell and shattered several bones in his right leg. Yates attempted to lower Simpson down the mountain 300 feet at a time, but the process was slow and painful for both men. With no food or water, they would both surely die--which left Yates with a painful choice to make--cutting Simpson loose, thus ensuring at least his own survival. This was only the beginning of Simpson's mind-boggling odyssey.Director Kevin McDonald (ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER) tells this compelling story by combining talking-head interviews with Simpson and Yates and stunningly photographed narrative footage--in which Simpson and Yates' ordeal is actually re-enacted on Siula Grande. McDonald's re-enactment footage is both engrossing and eye-popping and it could easily stand alone as its own one-of-a-kind adventure film. The interviews, however, add depth that make this a unique, thrilling, and emotional piece of cinema.Warning: This text is badly formed, therefore all tags have been stripped.",

The noteworthy directing-screenwriting duo of John Hillcoat and Nick Cave (The Proposition) returns with a Prohibition-era gangster flick about the notorious Bondurant brothers (Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, and Jason Clarke), whose peaceful distilling and bootlegging activities in the Virginia outback one day run up against the dogged resistance of Special Agent Rakes (a perverse dandy played by Guy Pearce). Despite its period framing, the film (which also features Gary Oldman, Jessica Chastain, and Mia Wasikowska) does have certain contemporary parallels. Although the Bondurant brothers operate an illegal business, they are also the most principled citizens of a town that is shot through with corruption.",

    "description": "Few movies in film history have been surrounded by as much controversy as I Spit on Your Grave, a story of multiple rapes and brutal revenge, so harsh and disturbing that its premiere in the early eighties finished with endless slanderous accusations and irate protests. In the role of a writer, back then Camille Keaton went through a horrible ordeal at the hands of a group of authentic savages and now it's actress Sarah Butler, without losing shred of atrocious realism, who's in charge of bearing the insufferable weight of a remake that, like the original movie, is not so much watched as it is undergone.

The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, The Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time — five tons of weapons-grade plutonium, far more than enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother. That is done The Expendables way...",

In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power. And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people.\r\n\r\n Robin Hood chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richard’s army against the French. Upon Richard’s death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marion (Oscar® winner Cate Blanchett), a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marion and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life. Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff. \r\n\r\n With their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure. This unlikeliest of heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more.\"",

The arrival of a new editor from outside Boston (Liev Schreiber) gives the team renewed impetus to tackle a story with explosive potential - particularly in a U.S. state where Catholicism is entrenched in every aspect of public life. Featuring superb performances from a fine ensemble cast (including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams), Spotlight makes a powerful case for the continuing importance of the profession of journalism. As such it has been compared to the 1976 classic All the President’s Men – a film which shares Spotlight’s riveting procedural rigour.",

In an assignment unlike any he’s ever known, he learns he’s part of a government experiment called the “Source Code,” a program that enables him to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack. Filled with mind-boggling twists and heart-pounding suspense, Source Code is a smart action-thriller directed by Duncan Jones (Moon) also starring Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye, Due Date), Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, The Departed), and Jeffrey Wright (Quantum of Solace, Syriana).",

Fact: In February of 1959, nine Russian hikers ventured into a remote area of the Ural Mountains in Russia. Fact: Two weeks later, all nine were found dead. Fact: What happened to them is a mystery that has baffled investigators and researchers for decades. It has become known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. Rumors have attributed their deaths to everything from alien encounters and government conspiracies to supernatural causes. To date, no one has been able to adequately explain what drove nine experienced hikers from their tents so frantically that they ripped through the material from the inside; or how their bodies came to be exposed to such dangerous amounts of radiation that it was still detected weeks later. And no one knows why they were discovered hundreds of yards from their camp, half dressed and with internal injuries including broken ribs and fractured skulls, but with no external wounds at all. The body of one young woman was even found missing her tongue. Present Day: Five ambitious American college students are issued a grant to return to the site of the orignal events in the belief that they can uncover and document the truth of what happened at Dyatlov's Pass. But what they find is more shocking than anything they could have imagined. Their trek through the Ural Mountains, retracing the steps of that ill-fated journey, is plagued by strange and increasingly terrifying phenomena, all of which suggest that in spite of their desolate surroundings, they are not alone. The forces behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident have been waiting for them.",

    "description": "John Dillinger became a legend during the Great Depression when he and his boys carried out a series of daring bank robberies. He thus became public enemy number one as determined by America’s justice system. In Public Enemies, J. Edgar Hoover sets dogged, experienced FBI Agent Purvis on Dillinger’s trail with orders to eliminate him and his gang. But Purvis comes up against the hard fact that most Americans consider his elegant and charismatic nemesis a modern-day Robin Hood. On top of that, the gangster has powerful protectors. Dillinger’s story has made it to the silver screen several times over the years. In Michael Mann’s version, the highly-regarded director chose a method – corresponding to his previous masterful works Heat (1995) and Miami Vice (2006) – that focuses on the ambivalent struggle between good and evil. This star-studded gangster drama is based on Bryan Burrough’s bestseller Public Enemies: America’s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34.",

    "description": "Righteous Kill pairs two cinematic icons whose previous screen collaboration, Michael Mann's 1995 Heat, was absolutely electrifying despite minimal time together in a long movie. Now in their mid-60s, De Niro and Pacino are playing veteran cops who, despite being grizzled, should look much younger than these actors. The incongruent casting makes the dark story improbable from the get-go, and things get worse as dialogue by screenwriter Russell Gurwitz quickly sounds like a parody of vintage cop movie cliches. It's a strain to find anything that works. The two leads play longtime detectives and partners whose weariness with rapists, murderers, pedophiles and other villains appears linked to the acts of a serial killer taking out bad guys who got away with heinouscrimes. A videotape confession by De Niro's tightly-coiled Turk--who has been seeking the killer with Pacino's Rooster--would seem to establish his ties to the events. But the movie isn't over until it's over, assuming one is still with the movie after plodding along with its facsimile of noir conviction. Director Jon Avnet never gets a handle on Righteous Kill's gritty heart, superficially pushing suspense along with heavy-handed editing, and adding unpersuasive sauce in the form of Turk's somewhat S&M sexual relationship with a female cop (Carla Gugino).

Thus the young man, who long refused to act the tough boss, inevitably becomes an even more ruthless master than his father. But Michael isn’t just a killing machine. Played by the mesmeric Al Pacino, sorrow is etched in the lines of his face as if he knew from the start that, after all the victories that toppled his adversaries, a great loneliness would await him in the end. In a subplot flashing back to 1920s New York, Robert De Niro excels as a young Vito who is building his position from the ground up. Coppola has everything perfectly under control, from imposing, high-profile situations in which the plot develops on several planes at once, down to minute details such as the Sicilian dialect, employed to perfection in Vito’s early scenes.",

The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems — and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The sort of film that in an earlier era would have been called a \"thinking man's thriller,\" The Hunt for Red October ushered in a new series of Hollywood-produced post-Cold War adventure films, including 1995's Crimson Tide.",

    "description": "Ever since \"Sin City\", Frank Miller has been a legend in the world of comic creators. Another of Miller's equally revered works is \"300\", on which Zack Snyder's current film is based. The story revolves around the battle of Thermopylae which took place 480 B.C., the film version of which, THE 300 SPARTANS, was to have a lasting impression on Miller as a child. Miller's comic refers directly to this 1962 cinemascope epic by Rudolph Maté about the battle of Thermopylae pass, during which 7,000 Greek soldiers faced an army of 120,000 Persians. Leonidas, the king of the Spartans, led an alliance of Greek city-states, while the Persians were commanded by Xerxes I. By positioning his troops strategically, Leonidas succeeded in thwarting the Persian advance. Only when a local shepherd named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks, revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines, were the Persians able to form a second front against Leonidas. In order to secure the retreat of the rest of his army, Leonidas barricaded himself into a fortress along with 300 loyal followers. Heroditus records that Leonidas was killed during the ensuing slaughter, and that his body was defiled by the Persians. However, the Spartans fought to regain the body of their king, and managed to hide it from their enemies to the very end. Although the Greeks were finally overwhelmed, the Persians had sustained significant losses.\r\nBy eschewing all use of original locations, opting instead for green screen and blue box techniques, Zack Snyder has succeeded brilliantly in transporting Frank Miller's comic aesthetic to the big screen.",

Richard Gere stars as Martin Vail, a famed defense lawyer who volunteers his services to Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a Kentucky teenager charged with the murder of a Chicago archbishop. Covered with blood, Aaron was captured after a foot chase broadcast live on TV, making a gleeful Vail certain that he could raise his profile by defending the obviously guilty suspect. Assigned to prosecute is Assistant District Attorney Janet Venable (Laura Linney), who is Vail's ex-girlfriend. Vail's case becomes more complicated than he expected when a psychologist, Dr. Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand) concludes that Stampler suffers from multiple personality disorder. Vail also uncovers evidence that the archbishop was involved in a corrupt land scheme and may have molested young parishioners. Now the cynical, opportunistic attorney is faced with a daunting prospect, a client who may actually deserve his best defense. ",

His mission is to put crime lord Capone (Robert De Niro) out of business, but Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone (Andy Garcia), and, joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.",

Every morning he ritualistically devotes himself to hygienic operations which both disgust and relax him. He doesn’t like getting up since he fears each new day. He’s horrified in advance by contact with the hated outside world, as well as with his ex-wife and teenage son. He turns on the television while eating and reacts with disgust to squabbles between members of parliament, offensive to a Polish patriot. The world of high ideals elevates him, the mundanity of everyday life brings him down. Above all, he takes umbrage at the vulgar ubiquity of advertising. For this reason he assiduously swallows pills for improving his intellectual and physical condition. He vents his permanent dissatisfaction through impertinent, almost rude behaviour. He has become accustomed to talking to himself and to monologues in which the word ‘fuck’ is luxuriously frequent.

Dedicated to making a change, he reunites with his former girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller) and rekindles their romance. But his dream of a legitimate life is undermined at every turn by ruthless former associates and even deadlier young thugs like Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo), who are out to make a name for themselves.

Martin Brest submits an effective and well-paced drama, in which he pits the protagonist against a strong opponent, fleshing out both characters in detail. His Lt. Col. Slade is a lonely and traumatized man, and in contrast to the bit part given to the young naïf in Dino Risi’s comedy, his companion here is a student of pure character trying to solve a fundamental moral dilemma. What else can Slade do but help him navigate this test? And, with the young man’s help, he thereby attains inner regeneration. Thanks to Al Pacino’s acting chops (he earned a Best Actor Oscar for the role), not even Slade’s pathos-ridden plaint to a university disciplinary committee loses one iota of its impact.",

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people.

On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets the assignment, and he chooses a translator, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davis), skilled in language but not in combat, to join his squad of right-hand man Sgt. Horvath (Tom Sizemore), plus privates Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), cynical Reiben (Edward Burns) from Brooklyn, Italian-American Caparzo (Vin Diesel), and religious Southerner Jackson (Barry Pepper), an ace sharpshooter who calls on the Lord while taking aim. Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E. Ambrose, and the incident is based on a true occurance in Ambrose's 1994 bestseller D-Day: June 6, 1944.",
